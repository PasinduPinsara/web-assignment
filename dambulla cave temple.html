Dambulla is the largest and best-preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka. The rock towers 160 m over the surrounding plains. There are more than 80 documented caves in the surrounding area. Major attractions are spread over ﬁve caves, which contain statues and paintings. These paintings and statues are related to Gautama Buddha and his life. <br>
There are a total of 153 Buddha statues, three statues of Sri Lankan kings and four statues of gods and goddesses. The latter include Vishnu and the Ganesha. The murals cover an area of 2,100 square meters (23,000 sq. ft.). Depictions on the walls of the caves include the temptation by the demon Mara, and Buddha's ﬁrst sermon. <br>
Prehistoric Sri Lankans would have lived in these cave complexes before the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka as there are burial sites with human skeletons about 2700 years old in this area, at Ibbankatuwa near the Dambulla cave complexes. <br>
This temple complex dates back to the ﬁrst century BCE.[2] It has ﬁve caves under a vast overhanging rock, carved with a drip line to keep the interiors dry. In 1938 the architecture was embellished with arched colonnades and gabled entrances. <br>
